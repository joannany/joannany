### Hi, I’m Anna 👋

I’m a **Senior AI Product Manager** specializing in the **reliability, economics, and industrial governance** of machine learning systems.

My work bridges ML research and real-world deployment, focusing on how frontier-scale models are evaluated, monitored, and sustainably operated under practical economic and physical constraints.

> **Note on authorship:**  
> The code in this repository and linked projects was developed with the assistance of generative AI tools. I define the problem framing, experiment design, evaluation logic, and interpretation of results, using AI to accelerate prototyping and iteration.
