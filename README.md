### Hi, I’m Anna 👋

I’m a **Senior AI Product Manager** specializing in the **reliability, economics, and industrial governance** of frontier machine learning systems.

My work bridges ML research and real-world deployment, focusing on how frontier-scale models are evaluated, monitored, and sustainably operated under practical economic and physical constraints.
