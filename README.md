### Hi, I’m Anna

Senior AI Product Manager focused on **evaluating, monitoring, and hardening** machine learning systems in production.

I build tools for:
- **Medical AI model monitoring** (real-world drift detection, calibration analysis, post-market evaluation)
- **Statistical evaluation frameworks** for calibration, threshold selection, and robust performance analysis
- **LLM behavioral reliability** (drift, safety boundaries, consistency) — in progress

My work sits at the intersection of research and product, with an emphasis on making AI systems **measurable, predictable, and operationally safe**.

### Featured Projects
- **Model Eval & Drift Lab** — Tools for detecting distribution shift, assessing calibration, and stress-testing deployed ML systems.
