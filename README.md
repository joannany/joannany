### Hi, I'm Anna 👋  
Senior AI Product Manager focused on *evaluating, monitoring, and hardening* ML systems.

I build tools for:
- **LLM behavioral reliability** (safety, drift, consistency)
- **Medical AI model monitoring** (real-world drift, calibration, post-market eval)
- **Statistical frameworks** for calibration, thresholding, and robust evaluation

My work sits at the intersection of research and product, focused on making AI systems measurable, predictable, and safe.

### 🔬 Featured Projects
- **LLM Behavior Evaluation Lab** — A modular framework for analyzing LLM safety, drift, and capability behavior.
- **Model Eval & Drift Lab** — Practical tools for detecting drift, calibrating models, and stress-testing ML systems.
