### Hi, I'm Anna 👋  
Senior AI Product Manager focused on *evaluating, monitoring, and hardening* ML systems.

I build tools for:
- **Medical AI model monitoring** (real-world drift, calibration, post-market eval)
- **Statistical frameworks** for calibration, thresholding, and robust evaluation
- (in progress) **LLM behavioral reliability** (safety, drift, consistency)

My work sits at the intersection of research and product, focused on making AI systems measurable, predictable, and safe.
